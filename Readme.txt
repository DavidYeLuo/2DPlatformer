Level two and three took longer than I expected.
I have encountered many bugs on my way of trying to implement 
a simple idea.
I tried many ways to tackle the problem but took me a long time to actually make it work.
I rushed my level 3 because of deadline and rushed a bit.
So for this reason, I don't think my code is readable.
However, I did learned a lot from this project.
